This mod was originally made by <a href="https://github.com/SamSWAT911">SamSWAT911</a>.

In their absence, I have decided to update the beloved FireSupport mod for 3.7.4; it will likely work with 3.7.1 to 3.7.4, but I have not tested the others besides 3.7.4.

At the moment, I have no plans to release a version for 3.6.x.

# Fire Support

BepInEx mod for [SPT-AKI](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/6-spt-aki/) emulator that will add insurgency-style fire support options into Escape From Tarkov.

This mod is tied to the in-game [rangefinder](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Vortex_Ranger_1500_rangefinder), so make sure it's in your inventory before you go into a raid. After you enter location, you will hear a radio message saying something like support is now available. Currently only A-10 autocannon strafe is implemented but I have plans to extend it later.

Double tap `Y` key (by default) to open gestures menu where you should notice new radial menu with available requests, their respective amounts and timer appearing after request in the center circle.

</details>

After you select support option, by clicking on it with `LMB`, vertical spotter mark will appear. Move your mouse around to choose position and then press `LMB` again. If you want to cancel request, you can do that by hitting `Left ALT` and `RMB`. Also, if your spotter can't hit any surface (e.g. you pointing into the sky) notice message will appear.

</details>

Autocannon strafe implies that there is a heading of where to shoot, so after you confirmed position, horizontal spotter will appear allowing you to choose direction by moving your mouse left or right. At this point you still can cancel request by pressing `Left ALT` and `RMB`, or, if you wish to confirm, press `LMB` once again.

</details>

After confirmation, you will hear a radio message from station about your support request and a short time later the A-10 will strike at the selected position and direction in a rectangular pattern. The kill zone lies somewhere between 20 to 40 metres in each direction from the horizontal spotter. Some settings like request amount and its cooldown along with radio messages volume are configurable in BepInEx Configuration Manager that opens with `F12` key.
